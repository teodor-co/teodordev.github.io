    <h1>Coach – Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="meta">Effective date: March 1, 2025</p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of Coach (the “App”), published by
      Teodor V. (“we”, “us”, or “our”). By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these
      Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      The App is intended for individuals who are at least 16 years old. By using the App, you confirm
      that you meet this requirement and have the legal capacity to agree to these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>2. License and Permitted Use</h2>
    <p>
      We grant you a personal, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use
      the App on your device for your own personal, non-commercial purposes.
    </p>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the App.</li>
      <li>Use the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
      <li>Infringe the rights of any third party while using the App.</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the operation of the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Accounts and Access</h2>
    <p>
      Coach does not require you to create an account. You are responsible for maintaining the
      security of your device and for any data stored locally within the App.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Workout and Usage Data</h2>
    <p>
      Coach allows you to log workout sessions and select a weekly training target. All workout logs,
      targets, and app state are stored locally on your device using device storage (AsyncStorage) and
      are not transmitted to our servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may collect limited anonymous usage analytics events (for example, event names indicating
      which features are used) to help us improve the App. These events do not include your workout
      logs, dates, targets, or any text you enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are solely responsible for the accuracy of the information you enter. Coach does not verify
      or validate workout data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> explains how Coach handles information.
      Please review it carefully. By using the App, you consent to the practices described there.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Coach Character Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      Coach is a <strong>fictional and imaginary character</strong> designed as a stylistic and
      motivational element of the App. The language used by Coach may be strict, ironic, sarcastic,
      or intentionally exaggerated as part of its character.
    </p>
    <p>
      All messages, phrases, and reactions presented by Coach are <strong>fictional and non-literal</strong>.
      Coach does not represent a real person, authority, trainer, or professional, and does not provide
      medical, psychological, or therapeutic advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coach is not intended to insult, shame, threaten, or harm users. Any harsh or provocative language
      is meant to be <strong>ironic, symbolic, and motivational in nature</strong> and must not be
      interpreted as a factual statement or personal judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you find the tone or behavior of Coach uncomfortable or distressing, you should discontinue
      use of the App. Coach is designed for users who are comfortable with a strict and confrontational
      motivational style.
    </p>

    <h2>7. No Medical or Professional Advice</h2>
    <p>
      Coach is provided for general informational and motivational purposes only. It does not provide
      medical, health, psychological, or professional advice. You should consult a qualified
      professional before starting or modifying any fitness routine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your use of the App and any decisions you make based on its content are solely at your own risk.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may release updates or enhancements to the App from time to time. These updates may add,
      modify, or remove features, including paid features. Continued use of the App after an update
      constitutes acceptance of the updated App and these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Third-Party Services and Content</h2>
    <p>
      The App may include or link to third-party content (such as open-source libraries). We are not
      responsible for third-party services, which are governed by their own terms and policies.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>

    <h2>11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      The App is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” without warranties of any kind. We do not warrant
      that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>

      consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App.

      protection laws of your country may also apply.
    </p>
