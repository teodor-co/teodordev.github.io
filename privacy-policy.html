    <h1>Worthify Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Effective date: March 1, 2025</p>

    <div class="notice">
      Worthify stores the information you enter locally on your device. We do not store your financial or goal information on our own servers and do not sell, share, or monetize your personal information. We do, however, collect limited anonymous usage events (such as event names indicating which features are used) via a third-party analytics service to help improve the App.
    </div>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how Worthify (“App”, “we”, “us”) handles information when you use the Worthify mobile application.
      By using Worthify, you agree to the practices described in this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Worthify allows you to input information to calculate the value of your time and manage savings goals. The App stores the following categories of data <strong>locally on your device</strong> using secure device storage (AsyncStorage):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Financial inputs:</strong> Monthly income, working hours per week, currency preferences.</li>
      <li><strong>Goal information:</strong> Goal titles, target amounts, icons, progress, and contribution history.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage preferences:</strong> Onboarding status, tutorials completed, selected themes, and other in-app settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No account registration is required, and we do not collect names, email addresses, or other contact details unless you choose to contact us directly.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>All financial, goal, and preference information you enter is stored and processed locally on your device. We use it only to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Calculate time value metrics based on your inputs.</li>
      <li>Display your savings goals and progress within the App.</li>
      <li>Provide personalized views (for example, currency display, selected themes).</li>
      <li>Remember that you have completed onboarding or tutorials.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not transmit or process this financial and goal data on external servers. However, we do send limited anonymous usage analytics events (such as event names indicating which features are used) to a third-party service to help improve the App; these events do not include your financial values, goal amounts, or text you enter.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All financial, goal, and preference data you enter is stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage.</li>
      <li>Data remains on your device until you delete it, uninstall the App, or clear the App’s data.</li>
      <li>You can reset your data by using system settings to delete the App’s storage or by reinstalling the App.</li>
      <li>Anonymous usage analytics events we send to our third-party provider may be stored for a limited time to help us understand usage and maintain the App; these events do not include your financial or goal values.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Transfers</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade any personal information. We do not transfer your financial or goal information to third parties. Worthify operates without remote servers for your financial and goal data, so this information never leaves your device unless you explicitly export or share it yourself. We do use a third-party service to process anonymous usage analytics events on our behalf; these events do not include your financial values, goal amounts, or text you enter.</p>

    <h2>5. Analytics and Tracking</h2>
    <p>Worthify uses a lightweight analytics implementation that records anonymous usage events (for example, event names indicating which features are used). We do not use advertising SDKs or third-party cookies, and we do not track your activity across other sites or apps.</p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may include open-source libraries (such as Expo, React Native, Lucide icons). These components run locally. If you follow any external links from the App (for example, to our policy pages), those services are governed by their own privacy policies. We recommend you review their policies before providing any information.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We rely on the built-in security of your device and the operating system’s storage mechanisms. To protect your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Set up a device passcode or biometric authentication.</li>
      <li>Keep your operating system updated.</li>
      <li>Only download Worthify from official app stores.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No method of electronic storage is perfectly secure; please use caution when entering sensitive information.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Because we do not collect or store your data on our servers, data rights under GDPR, CCPA, or similar regulations (access, correction, deletion, export) are handled by you directly on your device. To exercise these rights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Modify or delete information within the App.</li>
      <li>Delete the App or clear its storage from your device settings to remove all stored data.</li>
      <li>Reinstall the App if you want to start over with no data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you contact us directly (e.g., by email), we will only use your contact information to respond to your inquiry and will delete it once the request is resolved, unless you request otherwise or we are legally required to retain it.</p>

    <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Worthify is not intended for children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with their information, please contact us so we can remove it.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. When we do, we will update the “Effective date” at the top of this page. If changes materially affect how we handle your data, we will notify you within the App or through other appropriate means.</p>
    <p>Continued use of Worthify after an update means you accept the revised policy. If you do not agree, please stop using the App.</p>

    <h2>11. Contact</h2>
