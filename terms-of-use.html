    <h1>Worthify – Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="meta">Effective date: March 1, 2025</p>
    <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of Worthify (the “App”), published by Teodor V. (“we”, “us”, or “our”). By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for individuals who are at least 16 years old. By using the App, you confirm that you meet this requirement and have the legal capacity to agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. License and Permitted Use</h2>
    <p>We grant you a personal, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the App on your device for your own personal, non-commercial purposes.</p>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the App.</li>
      <li>Use the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
      <li>Infringe the rights of any third party while using the App.</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the operation of the App or the servers it runs on.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Accounts and Access</h2>
    <p>The App does not require you to create an account. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and ensuring that any data stored locally within the App remains secure.</p>

    <h2>4. Financial and Personal Data</h2>
    <p>The App allows you to record financial information (such as monthly income, working hours, savings goals, and related metrics) to help calculate time-based values. All information you enter is stored locally on your device using device storage (AsyncStorage) and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>
    <p>You are solely responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the data you enter. The App relies entirely on the information you provide to generate calculations; we do not verify or store that information remotely.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> explains how the App collects, stores, and uses information. Please review it carefully. By using the App, you consent to the practices described there.</p>

    <h2>6. No Financial Advice</h2>
    <p>The App is provided for general informational and educational purposes only. It does not provide financial, investment, legal, tax, or other professional advice. You should consult a qualified professional before making financial decisions.</p>
    <p>Your use of the App and the decisions you make based on its outputs are solely at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>7. Updates and Changes</h2>
    <p>We may release updates or enhancements to the App from time to time. These updates may add, modify, or remove features. Continued use of the App after an update means you accept the updated version and any accompanying changes to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Services and Content</h2>
    <p>The App may display or link to third-party content (for example, fonts or open-source icon sets). We are not responsible for the availability or accuracy of third-party content or services, and your use of them is at your own risk and subject to the applicable third-party terms and policies.</p>

    <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All intellectual property rights in the App and its content (including but not limited to text, graphics, logos, and software) are owned by or licensed to us. You may not reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works based on the App without our prior written permission, except as expressly permitted by these Terms.</p>
    <p>Open-source components included in the App are subject to their respective licenses. Attribution details are available in the App or accompanying documentation.</p>

    <h2>10. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The App is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free of viruses or other harmful components. We disclaim all warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your use or inability to use the App; (b) any content obtained from the App; or (c) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your data.</p>
    <p>In no event shall our aggregate liability for all claims relating to the App exceed the amount you paid us, if any, for using the App during the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.</p>

    <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Teodor V. and our affiliates from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or in any way connected with your use of the App, your violation of these Terms, or your infringement of any third-party rights.</p>

    <h2>13. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time for any reason, including if we believe you have violated these Terms. Upon termination, the license granted to you will automatically end, and you must cease all use of the App. Sections that by their nature should survive termination will do so (e.g., intellectual property, warranty disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnification).</p>

    <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of your country of residence, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. If you are located in the European Union, you may have specific consumer protections under your local laws.</p>

    <h2>15. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Effective date” above. Your continued use of the App after the revised Terms become effective constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using the App.</p>
